name: ship-feature
description: Runs the full untangle change pipeline end-to-end — requirements, solution design/review, branch, test-first unit/BDD/e2e, implementation, bug-fix loops, QA + coverage gate, manual test gate, merge, CI/CD, docs, and a post-change report. Invoke with the change request as the argument, e.g. `/ship-feature add a dark mode toggle to settings`.
---

You are driving a multi-step, largely-autonomous development pipeline for the untangle repo. You run in the main conversation and orchestrate specialized subagents via the `Agent` tool — you do all git/gh/file work and all direct user interaction yourself; subagents never talk to the user, they read/write files and return a `STATUS:` line you act on.

Read this whole file before acting. Follow the steps in order — they mirror the pipeline spec 1:1 (22 steps, after Step 13's base-path smoke check was added), so don't skip or reorder one even if it looks safe to shortcut.

## Pre-authorization (read this before Step 4)

The user has explicitly pre-authorized this workflow to create branches, merge to `main`, delete branches, and create GitHub issues **without pausing for per-action confirmation**, scoped exactly to what this file describes. Do not re-ask for confirmation at Steps 4, 15, or 22, or before filing a bug issue. This authorization does **not** extend to anything not described here — never force-push, never touch a branch this workflow didn't create, never change repo/branch-protection settings, never send messages outside GitHub issues/PRs this pipeline creates. If anything outside this file's scope comes up mid-run, stop and ask.

## Conventions

**Artifacts & state.** Everything for one run lives in `.workflow/<slug>/` (gitignored — local scratch, not part of the PR):

- `requirements.md`, `design.md` — the documents subagents read and write.
- `state.md` — plain markdown, updated immediately after every step completes: current step number, branch name, tracking issue number, per-layer test file lists (recorded at Steps 5/6/7), and open/closed bug issue numbers. This is what makes a run resumable.
- `meta.json` — `{"slug": ..., "started_at": ISO timestamp}`, written at Step 2 kickoff; feeds the Step 21 duration metric.

**Resuming.** If invoked with no clear new change request, look for `.workflow/*/state.md`. Exactly one incomplete → tell the user you're resuming it, pick up at its recorded step. More than one → `AskUserQuestion`. None → treat input as a new request.

**Slug.** Derive a short kebab-case slug from the request (e.g. "add a dark mode toggle" → `dark-mode-toggle`). Use it for the artifact directory and branch name `feature/<slug>`.

**Subagents never talk to the user.** Each agent's own file documents its exact `STATUS:` contract. You are the only thing that calls `AskUserQuestion` or otherwise addresses the user mid-pipeline.

**Continuing a subagent vs. spawning fresh.** When a step says "resume agent X with feedback Y", use `SendMessage` (load its schema via `ToolSearch` if not already loaded) addressed to the agent instance you spawned earlier in this run, so it keeps context. Only spawn a fresh `Agent` call the first time a role is needed in this run.

**Bug tracking.** File discrepancies/failures as GitHub issues: `gh issue create --label <label> --title "<slug>: <short summary>" --body "<detail>\n\nRelated to #<tracking-issue>"`. Create labels once if missing (`gh label list`, then `gh label create <name> --color <hex>` for any absent): `requirement`, `design`, `unit-test`, `bdd-test`, `e2e-test`, `qa`, `manual-test`, `deploy-path`, `ci`, `accessibility`, `security`. Close with `gh issue close <n> --comment "<what fixed it>"` once the matching check is green again.

**Accessibility.** This isn't a separate pipeline stage — it's a lens every stage applies to UI-facing work, per each agent's own instructions: requirements-analyst always writes testable WCAG 2.1 AA requirements for new/changed UI (not gated on the user asking); solution-designer/-reviewer treat an accessibility design gap the same as a functional coverage gap; the test-author agents wire automated `jest-axe` (unit)/`@axe-core/playwright` (e2e) WCAG scans alongside behavioral tests; the implementer treats the design's accessibility decisions as part of the implementation, not optional polish; qa-reviewer reviews it explicitly and can hand back `STATUS: accessibility-gap` (handled at Step 12 like a coverage gap). Tag any accessibility-specific bug issue with the `accessibility` label in addition to its stage label.

**Retry caps.** Every loop below (design review, per-layer red/green cycles, QA cycle, manual-test cycle, CI cycle) is capped at 5 iterations. If you hit the cap, stop, summarize what's failing, and ask the user how to proceed (`AskUserQuestion`: keep trying / take over manually / abandon) rather than looping forever.

**Commits.** After every step that changes files, `git add` only the files that step touched and commit `<slug>: <step description>`. Never commit `.workflow/`. Never use `--no-verify` or force operations.

**npm script contract.** CI/CD and every test-running step assume these scripts exist in `package.json`: `build`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `dev`, `test:unit`, `test:bdd`, `test:e2e`, `test:coverage:merge` (outputs one combined coverage % across all three layers). If any is missing, the Step 3 solution design and Step 8 implementation must include adding it — don't silently skip a test layer because the script is missing.

---

## Step 1 — Intake

The user's request that invoked `/ship-feature` _is_ Step 1. Nothing to do here except read it carefully before Step 2.

## Step 2 — Requirements (human gate #1)

1. New run: derive the slug, `mkdir .workflow/<slug>`, write `meta.json` with `started_at`, initialize `state.md` at step `2-requirements`.
2. Spawn `Agent(subagent_type="requirements-analyst")` with the raw request and the path to `.workflow/<slug>/requirements.md`.
3. While it reports `STATUS: needs-input`: relay its questions to the user (`AskUserQuestion` if they're multiple-choice-shaped, otherwise plain conversation), then `SendMessage` the answers back to the same agent as an `ANSWERS:` section. Repeat.
4. When it reports `STATUS: ready`: show the user its summary and the full `requirements.md`, and explicitly ask for approval (`AskUserQuestion`: approve / request changes). If they request changes, `SendMessage` the feedback to the same agent and re-check. Cycle until approved.
5. On approval: append `Approved by user on <date>` to `requirements.md`. Create the tracking issue: `gh issue create --title "<slug>" --body "$(cat .workflow/<slug>/requirements.md)"`. Record its number in `state.md`.

## Step 3 — Solution design + review loop

1. Spawn `Agent(subagent_type="solution-designer")` with `requirements.md` and the path to `design.md` (to be created).
2. Spawn `Agent(subagent_type="solution-reviewer")` with both document paths and the repo root.
3. If `STATUS: approved`, move on.
4. If `STATUS: changes-requested` (with a feedback list): `gh issue create --label design ...` for each discrepancy, `SendMessage` the full feedback to the Step 3.1 solution-designer agent to amend `design.md`, then re-spawn a fresh `solution-reviewer` against the updated design (it's stateless per review). Close resolved issues (`gh issue close ... --comment "Resolved in updated design"`). Repeat, capped at 5 cycles.
5. Record `state.md` at step `3-design-approved`.

## Step 4 — Branch

`git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b feature/<slug>`. Record the branch name in `state.md`. (Skip creating a branch only if Step 3's design concludes no code change is needed at all — rare; ask the user if genuinely unsure.)

## Step 5 — Unit tests (red)

Spawn `Agent(subagent_type="unit-test-author")` with `design.md`. It reviews existing unit tests, adds/changes/removes what's needed for this change, and runs exactly the changed/added tests to confirm they fail (existing unrelated tests are untouched and must stay green). On `STATUS: red-confirmed`, record the exact file list in `state.md` under `unit-test-files`. Commit `<slug>: add/update unit tests (red)`.

## Step 6 — BDD tests (red)

Spawn `Agent(subagent_type="bdd-test-author")` with `design.md`. Same pattern as Step 5 for Cucumber features/steps (`test:bdd` scoped to the changed feature files). On `STATUS: red-confirmed`, record `bdd-test-files` in `state.md`. Commit `<slug>: add/update BDD tests (red)`.

## Step 7 — E2E tests (red)

Spawn `Agent(subagent_type="e2e-test-author")` with `design.md`. Same pattern for Playwright specs. On `STATUS: red-confirmed`, record `e2e-test-files` in `state.md`. Commit `<slug>: add/update e2e tests (red)`.

## Step 8 — Implementation

Spawn `Agent(subagent_type="implementer")` with `design.md` and the three test-file lists from `state.md`. It implements the solution until those specific files pass (it may run them repeatedly, but this is still scoped — not the full suite yet). On `STATUS: green`, commit `<slug>: implement solution`. On `STATUS: blocked`, surface the reason to the user and ask how to proceed.

## Step 9 — Unit test suite (full) + bug loop

Run the **full** unit suite yourself: `npm run test:unit`. On failure: `gh issue create --label unit-test --title "<slug>: unit test failure" --body "<failure output>\n\nRelated to #<tracking-issue>"`, spawn/`SendMessage` `Agent(subagent_type="bug-fixer")` with the failure output and `test:unit`, re-run the full suite when it reports `STATUS: fixed`, close the issue once green. Repeat until the full suite passes, capped at 5 cycles. Commit after each fix.

## Step 10 — BDD test suite (full) + bug loop

Same pattern as Step 9, running `npm run test:bdd`, label `bdd-test`.

## Step 11 — E2E test suite (full) + bug loop

Same pattern as Step 9, running `npm run test:e2e`, label `e2e-test`.

## Step 12 — QA review + coverage gate

1. Spawn `Agent(subagent_type="qa-reviewer")` with the full diff (`git diff main...HEAD`), `design.md`, and `requirements.md`. It reviews best practice/readability/efficiency/maintainability/testability/accessibility, sanity-checks against requirements, computes combined coverage (`npm run test:coverage:merge`), and makes any code-quality/small-a11y fixes directly. As of the `audit`/`e2e-tests`/`coverage-merge` CI jobs (`ci.yml`), the audit/e2e/coverage gates this step enforces are now also enforced automatically on every push/PR, as defense-in-depth for any change that reaches `main` outside this pipeline (e.g. a Dependabot PR, or a manual commit). This step's own gates remain the pre-merge, fast-feedback path _within_ a pipeline run — don't skip Step 12 on the assumption CI will catch it; CI is the backstop, not a replacement for the in-pipeline check.
2. On `STATUS: security-gap` (a security-hygiene finding qa-reviewer couldn't resolve itself —
   see its `FINDINGS` list): `gh issue create --label security --label qa --title "<slug>: security — <short summary>" --body "<finding>\n\nRelated to #<tracking-issue>"`
   for each finding (create the `security` label once if missing, per the existing "Bug tracking"
   convention). Then, per finding:
   - **Committed secret/credential**: do not attempt automated remediation of the secret's
     _value_ — rotating/revoking a credential is an out-of-band action this pipeline has no
     pre-authorization to perform. `AskUserQuestion`, surfacing the exact file/location (never
     the secret value itself) and asking the user to rotate/revoke it externally and confirm.
     Once confirmed, spawn/`SendMessage` `bug-fixer` to remove the committed value from the
     file going forward (do not rewrite git history) and close the issue.
   - **Unsanitized rendering, or an audit finding with no direct fix available**: if it implies
     a design change (e.g. sanitization needs a hook the current architecture doesn't have),
     `SendMessage` the finding to the Step 3 solution-designer agent to amend `design.md` first,
     re-review via a fresh `solution-reviewer`, then implementer/`bug-fixer`; otherwise
     spawn/`SendMessage` `bug-fixer` directly with the finding and its reproduce command (e.g.
     `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`, or the specific rendering call site).

   Once every finding (of either kind above) is resolved: re-run the full Step 9–11 suites as a
   safety net, close the issue(s), then re-spawn `qa-reviewer` fresh. Counts toward the same
   5-iteration cap as the rest of Step 12.

3. On `STATUS: accessibility-gap` (a UI surface is missing an automated WCAG scan, or has a violation the reviewer couldn't fix directly): `gh issue create --label accessibility --label qa ...` for each finding, route back to the matching Step 5/6/7 test-author agent(s) (unit-test-author/e2e-test-author for the missing scan; solution-designer first if the finding implies a design gap, not just a missing test) to add coverage or request a design fix, then re-run Steps 9–11 for the affected layer(s), close the issue(s), then re-spawn `qa-reviewer` fresh.
4. On `STATUS: coverage-gap` (combined coverage below the threshold defined in `.claude/STANDARDS.md`, listing which layer(s) need more cases): route back to the matching Step 5/6/7 author agent(s) to add coverage, then re-run Steps 9–11 for the affected layer(s), then re-spawn `qa-reviewer` fresh.
5. On `STATUS: changes-made`: re-run the full Step 9–11 suites (safety net). Any failure follows the normal bug-fixer loop from those steps.
6. On `STATUS: approved` (no changes needed, coverage at or above the threshold defined in `.claude/STANDARDS.md`): move on.
7. Cap the whole Step 12 cycle at 5 iterations.

## Step 13 — Base-path smoke check (pre-merge)

Steps 7 and 11 run `test:e2e` against a local preview built with the default base path, so they never exercise the production base path the app is actually served under once deployed — that gap is exactly what let CD-only path bugs (relative `goto`/`request` calls resolving off the deployed subpath instead of against it) reach production undetected before this step existed. Catch it here, pre-merge, reusing the same build flag and `BASE_URL` mechanism CD's `e2e-live` job uses against the real deployment — just pointed at a local server instead.

1. Check `design.md`/`vite.config.ts` for how the production base path is set (untangle's `GITHUB_PAGES=true` env flag). If a change genuinely has no non-root production base path implication, this step is a no-op — record that in `state.md` and move on.
2. Otherwise, build with that production flag: `GITHUB_PAGES=true npm run build`.
3. Serve it with the **same flag** as step 2: `GITHUB_PAGES=true npm run preview -- --port 4174 --strictPort` in the background. `vite preview` recomputes `base` from the environment at the moment it starts — it does not read whatever was baked into the build — so omitting the flag here serves assets at `/` while the built `index.html` references them under `/untangle/`, a silent mismatch (module scripts 404 via the SPA fallback, the page renders empty, no console error). The preview server's printed local URL already includes the production base path when the flag is set; read that URL from its output rather than assuming `http://localhost:4174/`.
4. Run the full e2e suite against it: `BASE_URL=<url from step 3> npm run test:e2e`. This exercises the exact same specs and the exact same relative-vs-absolute-path code paths as CD's `e2e-live` job.
5. Stop the preview server.
6. On any failure: `gh issue create --label deploy-path --title "<slug>: base-path smoke check failure" --body "<failure output>\n\nRelated to #<tracking-issue>"`, spawn/`SendMessage` `Agent(subagent_type="bug-fixer")` with the failure output and the repro command from step 4, re-run steps 2–4 once it reports `STATUS: fixed`, close the issue once green. Repeat until passing, capped at 5 cycles.

## Step 14 — Manual test gate (human gate #2)

1. Start the app locally (`npm run dev`) and give the user the local URL.
2. Ask (`AskUserQuestion` or plain question) whether manual testing passed, or isn't needed.
3. If the user reports a bug: `gh issue create --label manual-test --title "..." --body "<what the user reported>\n\nRelated to #<tracking-issue>"`, spawn/`SendMessage` `Agent(subagent_type="bug-fixer")` with the report, re-run the full Steps 9–11 suites as a safety net once it reports `STATUS: fixed`, close the issue, ask the user to re-test. Loop until confirmed pass (or explicitly not required).

## Step 15 — Merge to main

On confirmation from Step 14: push the branch (`git push -u origin feature/<slug>`), open a PR (`gh pr create --title "<slug>" --body "Closes #<tracking-issue>" --base main --head feature/<slug>`), record the PR number in `state.md`. This push is what triggers CI (Steps 16–17).

## Steps 16–17 — CI / CD

These run in GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` on push/PR, `.github/workflows/cd.yml` on merge to main) — nothing to do here except watch them:
`gh pr checks <pr-number> --watch`.

## Step 18 — CI bug-fix loop

On any CI job failure: `gh issue create --label ci --title "<slug>: CI failure — <job name>" --body "<job output>\n\nRelated to #<tracking-issue>"`, spawn/`SendMessage` `Agent(subagent_type="bug-fixer")` with the job output and which local command reproduces it (map job→command: lint→`npm run lint`, typecheck→`npm run typecheck`, build→`npm run build`, unit→`npm run test:unit`, bdd→`npm run test:bdd`, format→`npm run format:check` (if it fails, the fix is `npm run format` to auto-fix, then re-run `format:check`), audit→`npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`, e2e→`npm run test:e2e`, coverage-merge→`npm run test:coverage:merge` (must print a combined percentage ≥ the threshold in `.claude/STANDARDS.md`)), push the fix, re-watch CI, close the issue once green. Cap at 5 cycles.

Once all CI jobs are green: `gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash --delete-branch`. This performs the merge (triggering CD) and deletes the remote branch — and if the current checkout is on `feature/<slug>`, `gh` also switches it back to `main` and deletes the local branch as part of the same command. So by Step 22, local cleanup is very often already done; treat it as the expected common case, not an edge case.

## Step 19 — CD failure logging (no auto-fix)

Watch the CD run: `gh run watch $(gh run list --workflow=cd.yml --branch main --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')`. Any failing job: `gh issue create --label ci --title "<slug>: CD failure — <job name>" --body "<job output>\n\nRelated to #<tracking-issue>"`. Per spec, do **not** auto-fix these — just log and tell the user. Wait for CD to finish (pass or fail) before Step 20.

## Step 20 — Documentation update

Spawn `Agent(subagent_type="docs-updater")` with the full diff of what merged (`git diff <previous-main-sha>..<merge-sha>`) and `requirements.md`/`design.md`. On `STATUS: updated`, commit directly to `main` (docs-only, no branch/PR needed): `git checkout main && git pull`, apply, `git add CLAUDE.md README.md <other files> && git commit -m "<slug>: update docs" && git push`.

## Step 21 — Post-change report

Spawn `Agent(subagent_type="report-generator")` with the full `.workflow/<slug>/` directory and `gh issue list --label <tracking-issue-derived-search> --state all` (or search by "Related to #<tracking-issue>" in issue bodies) for the bug list. It writes `reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md` with requirements, solution, test changes, all bugs raised + final status, and total time (`meta.json.started_at` to now — note this includes human wait time, not just active engineering time). Commit and push this directly to `main` alongside Step 20, or as its own small commit.

## Step 22 — Cleanup

The remote branch was already deleted by Step 18's `gh pr merge --delete-branch`, and — per that step's note — the local branch is very often already gone too (`gh` deletes it and switches you back to `main` automatically if it was checked out during the merge). Check before acting rather than assuming either outcome:

1. `git branch --list feature/<slug>`. If it's empty, the local branch is already cleaned up — just confirm you're on `main` (`git checkout main` is a safe no-op if already there) and skip straight to step 3.
2. If it still exists (e.g. the merge ran from a different checkout/worktree than the one driving this pipeline), delete it: `git checkout main && git branch -d feature/<slug>`.
3. Mark `state.md` complete. `main` should now be the only branch.

Report a short summary to the user: what shipped, the PR/commit, the tracking issue, total bugs raised/resolved, and the report file path.
