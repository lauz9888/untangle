description: On-demand trigger for untangle's periodic quality/velocity rollup — spawns `quality-reporter` to write fresh weekly (past 8 weeks) and monthly (since Waypoint's adoption in this project) reports to `reports/metrics/`, the same reports the `ship-feature` pipeline generates automatically every 10 releases (its Step 21a). Invoke with `/quality-report` — no arguments needed.

You are triggering an on-demand run of the periodic quality report. This is a single-purpose
skill: no pipeline state, no tests to run — it's a read-only rollup over data that already exists
in `reports/*.md`, shipped through a small housekeeping PR rather than a direct push.

## What you do

1. Spawn `Agent(subagent_type="quality-reporter")`. It needs no input beyond the repo itself — it
   reads every `reports/*.md` metrics block and `reports/.release-count` directly.
2. On `STATUS: complete`: open a small PR for the two new files, the same reviewed-not-direct-push
   convention `ship-feature`'s Step 21a uses for its own report/docs writes: `git checkout main &&
git pull && git checkout -b quality-report/<date>`, `git add reports/metrics/ && git commit -m
"quality-report: weekly + monthly rollup"`, `git push -u origin quality-report/<date>`, `gh pr
create --title "quality-report: <date> rollup" --body "On-demand periodic quality report." --base
main --head quality-report/<date>`, then `gh pr merge quality-report/<date> --auto --squash
--delete-branch`. If the repo has no auto-merge enabled, leave the PR open and tell the user it
   needs a manual merge instead of falling back to a direct push.
3. Tell the user the two file paths from the agent's `REPORTS:` line, whether the PR merged or is
   waiting on a manual merge, plus a one- or two-sentence summary of the headline numbers (release
   velocity trend, post-merge delivery-failure rate) pulled from the reports you just wrote — don't
   make them open the files to get the top-line answer.

## If there isn't enough history yet

If `quality-reporter` reports fewer than 2 total releases exist yet (see its own "What you do"
step 5), still write and commit the reports — they'll just say so plainly — and pass that along
when reporting back to the user rather than treating it as a failure.

There's no loop, no retry cap, and no human gate here — it's a deterministic read over existing
data, so a bad run just gets re-triggered next time this skill (or the automatic Step 21a trigger)
runs.
